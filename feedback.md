## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Folks, this is a great idea for a project and definitely fits with the spirit of what I'm hoping you would do. I'm a bit concerned that this might be a little more than you can do in the given time, that is, this seems a bit ambitious. I'm hoping by next week you can narrow this down a bit to modeling some particular aspect - maybe the basic model of dynamos and how they work. It might be that we start there and expand into another area by adding a new feature to the model. This is a great idea, I just don't want you to do a PhD for this project.

* Score: 20/20

## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Folks, the plan that you have here works for me and helps me understand what you will be doing. It does appear that the responsbilities on the project haven't been parted out as much as they probably should be (i.e., who is going to do what) and this might become a problem later as you are working on this. I'm still also curious as to what you intend to model, but I guess you plan to think through that this week and share it. My reminder would be to aim small first and think about aspects that could be added on as you want.

* Score: 16/20

## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Folks, this is a great idea for a project and definitely fits with the spirit of what I'm hoping you would do. I'm a bit concerned that this might be a little more than you can do in the given time, that is, this seems a bit ambitious. I'm hoping by next week you can narrow this down a bit to modeling some particular aspect - maybe the basic model of dynamos and how they work. It might be that we start there and expand into another area by adding a new feature to the model. This is a great idea, I just don't want you to do a PhD for this project.
